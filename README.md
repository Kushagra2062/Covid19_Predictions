This is a python project created by me where I predict two things
- What would have been the number of cases daily in Victoria had the Stage 4 restrictions not been implemented i.e I justify the implementation of Stage 4 restrictions in Victoria.
- I have predicted the daily number of Covid cases in Victoria for the upcoming week on the basis of the data from the previous week. With these predictions the government can be ready in advance to combat coronavirus for the upcoming week.

Both these predictions were done using the Arima model.
